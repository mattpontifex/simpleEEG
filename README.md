# simpleEEG
A set of EEGLAB/ERPLAB functions that enhance the functionality of the point and click GUI.

To use these functions, click the "Clone or download" button on the right and then select "Download ZIP". Once the file has downloaded, unzip the package and then copy the simpleEEGX.X file into the EEGLAB plugins folder. 

Once you restart EEGLAB, along the EEGLAB toolbar you should now see a label for "Simple EEG" that contains a set of generally useful EEG and ERP processing tools.

Each function, when run, will also output equivalent code that can be run with a script or function.
